If interested, please help with a python script to extract data from fields
in an xml file and insert it into certain fields within a
yml file that matches a specific yml hierarchy.

To run what i have thusfar:

$ ./simple_xml_parser.py XML-Input.xml YML-Output.yml


This will print the extracted xml fields to the console.
I next need to get those values into a yml formated file similar
to the file in the /resources directory.


I appreciate any and all PRs - Thanks.
