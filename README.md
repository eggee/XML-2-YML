Please help me with a python script to extract data from fields
in an xml file and insert it into certain fields within a
yml file that matches a specific yml hierarchy.

The YML-output(example).yml is an example version of how i would like
the file to look after the script is done getting the specific field 
data from the XML-input.xml file.

execution might look like

$ python xml2yml.py XML-input.xml <new-yml-filename>.yml

I appreciate any and all PRs - Thanks.
