Please help me with a python script to extract data from fields
in an xml file and insert it into certain fields within a
yml file that will ensure a specific xml hierarchy.

The YML-Sample.yml is an exact version of how i want the
file to look after it gets the specific field data from
the XML-input.xml file.

execution might look like

python xml2yml.py <in_file> <out_file>
or
python xml2yml.py XML-input.xml YML-output

I appreciate any and all PRs - Thanks.
